Game in handheld view.


## Objectives
Get as many goldfish as you can before your scoop breaks.

### Minimum System Requirements:
+ A Laptop with a minimum screen width of 800 pixels
+ Handheld device must be in landscape mode


##Items
+ A pool of fish
+ A bowl
+ A poi (or paper scooper)

## Gameplay
The game starts with a number of goldfish swimming in a shallow pool.  The player has to scoop the fish with the poi and place them in the bowl. Because it is made of paper, the poi won't hold fish very long.  The longer the poi is in the water, the weaker it is.  The weight of the fish also weakens the poi.  If the poi is too weak it will break.  How many fish can you get before your poi breaks?  Play the game and see!

## Directions
+ If you are using a handheld device, ensure it is in Landscape mode.
+ Click the start button to begin.
+ Press the left mouse button down in the pool to dip the poi in the pool
+ Release the mouse button to remove the poi from the pool
+ Fish will be caught in the poi if they are within range of the poi when it leaves the pool
+ If you have fish in your poi, move the poi over the inside of bowl and click it.
+ All the fish in your poi will now be moved to the bowl, and your fish count will increase.
+ You win if you get all the fish in the bowl.
+ You lose if your poi breaks before all the fish are moved into the bowl.

###Note:
+ Make sure you are in landscape mode if you are using a handheld device.
